ðŸ¤– Task 5: Auto Tagging Support Tickets Using LLM
ðŸŽ¯ Objective

Automatically tag support tickets into relevant categories using a local Large Language Model (LLM) pipeline with prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and few-shot learning techniques.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

A small synthetic support ticket dataset consisting of free-text issue descriptions labeled with one or more tags:

Example tags:

Billing

Sales

Technical Issue

Account Management

ðŸ”§ Steps Performed

Prompt Engineering (Zero-Shot Inference)

Used zero-shot-classification pipeline from Hugging Face to generate tag predictions without training.

Returned top 3 most probable tags for each ticket.

Fine-Tuning a Text Classifier

Vectorized the text using TF-IDF

Used LogisticRegression for multi-label classification

Trained on the ticket dataset and evaluated using classification metrics

Few-Shot Learning Simulation

Augmented training with a small number of labeled examples to improve performance

Added synthetic few-shot prompts to enhance context for the model

Performance Comparison

Compared predictions from:

Zero-shot classification

Fine-tuned classifier

Displayed true labels, predicted zero-shot tags, and fine-tuned top-3 tags for each test ticket
